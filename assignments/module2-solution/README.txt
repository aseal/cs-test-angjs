Module 2 solution
=================

The idea of this assignment is to create a "check off" shopping List application.


The HTML page displays 2 lists, one titled "To Buy" and the other "Already Bought".

The "To Buy" list is pre-populated with a list of at least 5 items.  Next to each item in the list there is a button with the label "Bought". When the user clicks on the "Bought" button, its associated item is be removed from the "To Buy" list and appear in the "Already Bought" list.

The "Already Bought" list is initially be empty and display a message "Nothing bought yet".
